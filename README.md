# String-Searching-Algorithms
Motivation behind this project is to discuss various String Searching Algorithms. We will be focusing on Exact string-searching algorithms. Four exact string-searching algorithms are discussed in detail and we compare the efficiency of each algorithms to determine the best.
The four String Searching Algorithms focussed are:
Na√Øve method

Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm

Boyer Moore Algorithm

Rabin Karp Algorithm
